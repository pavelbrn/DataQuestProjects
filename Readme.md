# DataQuest Projects Repository

These are the solutions to my DataQuest Projects. 
All of my solutions differ in code/comments from the official DataQuest versions, but all end results should be the same.

The directory custom-python-functions contains useful fucntions I made that were reusable during the duration of the course.
 
In the course I chose to do the Python version of the Data Scientist pathway.
